<body><h1>The Rolling-Moon</h1>

	<h2>Dependences</h2>
<p>	To play this game you need the Chipmunk 2D physics engine,
	which you can find here:<br />
	<a href="http://code.google.com/p/chipmunk-physics/"
		>http://code.google.com/p/chipmunk-physics/</a>
	<br />
	You also need its ocaml wrapper:<br />
	<a href="http://www.linux-nantes.org/~fmonnier/OCaml/Chipmunk/"
		>http://www.linux-nantes.org/~fmonnier/OCaml/Chipmunk/</a>
	<br />
	And the graphics rendering is made through this OCaml-OpenGL wrapper:<br />
	<a href="http://www.linux-nantes.org/~fmonnier/OCaml/GL/"
		>http://www.linux-nantes.org/~fmonnier/OCaml/GL/</a>
</p>

	<h2>Launch the game</h2>
<p>	Just run the command 'make' which will compile and run the game.<br />
</p>

	<h2>How to play</h2>
<p>	Use the left and right arrows to rotate the level which makes move the avatar ball.
	The goal is to touch all the target green circles of the level.<br />
	While playing you can make pauses with the 'P' key, and you can restart the level
	with the 'Z' key, or go to the next level with 'N'.<br />
	You can also access the commands with a right clic in the window.
</p>

	<h2>Command line arguments</h2>
<pre>
    -l  --level        level.data file (several ones can be given)
    -t  --texture      texture jpeg image
    -r  --resolution   size of the window, for exemple "640x480" (the default)
    -w  --wireframe    minimal rendering for slow machines
    -b  --no-bg        in textured mode, only fills the level,
                       but not the background (for Mesa users)
</pre>

	<h2>Designing New Levels</h2>
<p>	Creating new levels is not very difficult.
	You can use the SVG editor Inkscape to create levels in WYSIWYG.
	The easiest way is probably to edit an existing one, and to modify it,
	then save it selecting "Compressed Inkscape SVG".
	Then convert the SVG source in binary level data with:<br />
<code>	./mk-level-data.sh  level.x.svgz  level.x.data </code>
</p>
<p>	Then just load it in the game with:<br />
<code>	./rolling-moon.ml  -l level.x.data </code>
</p>
<p>	If you prefer to create one from scratch, here is how to do:
	you need to add a 'class' argument to the element to tell its type.
	You can do so in the XML editor of Inkscape.
	For the avatar (at its initial position) add 
	<code> class="avatar"</code>.
	For level parts add <code>class="level"</code>, for the targets add
	<code>class="target"</code>.
	for the level paths it need to be not closed,
	and bezier curves are not recognised yet.
</p>
<p>	If the tesselation of paths that are inside another path is not as
	expected, you may need to use "path &gt; invert" in the Inkscape menu,
	with the related path selected.
</p>

	<h2>Sharing Your Levels</h2>
<p>	Send them to me &lt;monnier.florent(at)gmail.com&gt; and I will
	include these in the tarball!
</p>

	<h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>	Rolling-Moon is inspired by the SNES game "On The Ball"
	(its japaneese name was "CamelTry").<br />
	If you are interested you can see a video of "On The Ball" on youtube
	<a href="http://fr.youtube.com/watch?v=CHS00nAgdk4">here</a>.

<p>	<em>Have Fun!</em>

--- Interoperability ---

The module FunGL have its own c stub (file fungl.wrap.c) so if you wish
to use (or include) it with another OpenGL binding you can do it with
very little effort. What you need to do is to remove the reference to 
the module GL in the types.
For example for a function defined like this:

  val func: param:GL.gl_type -> unit

you need to change it to:

  #include "enums/gl_type.inc.ml"
  val func: param:gl_type -> unit

(except for draw_with_material and draw_with_lightModel which would
 need some manual edit)
Then recompile, and that's it!

You can also, after having preprocessed the #include type, use the sed script:
 ../LablGL/glMLite_to_LablGL.sed.sh
to change the type names from glMLite to LablGL.
